# go-gl-utils
Some utility functions to deal with common OpenGL tasks.

Uses _OpenGL - Core Profile 4.1_ (aka "modern OpenGL") since it's the latest version supported by MacOS. 

It is partially based on [GoJira2D](https://github.com/maxfish/gojira2d) with the idea of having simpler, decoupled,
utilities instead of yet another framework.

## Dependencies
* [Go-GL](https://github.com/go-gl) as GL bindings
* [MathGL](https://github.com/go-gl/mathgl) as math library
